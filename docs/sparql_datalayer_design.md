# AshRDF SPARQL DataLayer Design

## Executive Summary

The AshRDF SPARQL DataLayer will provide seamless integration between Ash resources and RDF data accessed via SPARQL endpoints. This implementation will:

1. Allow Ash resources to read from and write to SPARQL endpoints
2. Support both HTTP and WebSocket protocols using Mint/Finch
3. Provide bidirectional mapping between RDF graphs and Ash resources
4. Translate Ash queries to optimized SPARQL queries
5. Support rich querying including filtering, pagination, sorting, and aggregation
6. Integrate with Ash's relationship capabilities
7. Leverage existing AshRDF functionality for RDF handling

The architecture is modular, allowing future extensions while maintaining a clean, maintainable codebase with comprehensive test coverage.

## Key Components

1. **SPARQL Client**
   - Abstraction layer for SPARQL protocol communication
   - HTTP implementation using Finch (built on Mint)
   - WebSocket implementation for real-time data
   - Connection pooling and management

2. **Query Builder**
   - Translates Ash queries to SPARQL queries
   - Supports various query types (SELECT, CONSTRUCT, etc.)
   - Handles filters, sorting, and pagination
   - Optimizes generated queries

3. **Result Parser**
   - Converts SPARQL response formats to Elixir data
   - Maps results to Ash resource structures
   - Handles data type conversions

4. **RDF-to-Ash Mapper**
   - Maps RDF classes to Ash resources
   - Maps RDF properties to Ash attributes
   - Handles relationships between resources
   - Manages URI generation and resolution

5. **DataLayer Implementation**
   - Implements Ash.DataLayer behavior
   - Provides CRUD operations
   - Manages relationships
   - Handles transactions where supported

6. **DSL Extension**
   - Configures SPARQL endpoints
   - Defines RDF-to-Ash mappings
   - Manages prefixes and namespaces

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (2 weeks)
- Implement core SPARQL client with HTTP support
- Create basic query builder for simple queries
- Implement minimal DataLayer supporting basic read operations
- Design and implement DSL for SPARQL configuration
- Setup project structure and testing infrastructure

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (3 weeks)
- Complete DataLayer implementation with full CRUD support
- Enhance query builder with filter, sort, and pagination
- Implement result parser for different response formats
- Create RDF-to-Ash mapping system for attributes
- Add connection pooling and error handling

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (2 weeks)
- Add relationship support
- Implement WebSocket client for real-time updates
- Add query optimization strategies
- Support aggregations and advanced filtering
- Implement transaction support where possible

### Phase 4: Polishing (1 week)
- Performance optimization
- Comprehensive documentation
- Example applications
- Integration tests with common SPARQL endpoints

## Challenges and Mitigation

1. **Mapping Between Models**
   - **Challenge**: Bridging RDF's graph model with Ash's resource model
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive mapping system with flexible configuration options

2. **Query Optimization**
   - **Challenge**: SPARQL queries can be slow if not optimized
   - **Mitigation**: Implement sophisticated query planning and pattern ordering

3. **SPARQL Endpoint Variations**
   - **Challenge**: Endpoints may support different features
   - **Mitigation**: Feature detection and graceful fallbacks

4. **Connection Management**
   - **Challenge**: Efficiently managing connections to SPARQL endpoints
   - **Mitigation**: Connection pooling with health checks and circuit breakers

5. **Data Type Handling**
   - **Challenge**: Mapping between RDF literals and Elixir types
   - **Mitigation**: Robust type conversion system with customization options

## Testing Approach

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test individual components in isolation
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Focus on function-level behavior

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test components working together
   - Use in-memory SPARQL endpoints for testing

3. **System Tests**
   - Test against real SPARQL endpoints (Apache Jena, Virtuoso)
   - Verify real-world compatibility

4. **Property-Based Tests**
   - Use property testing for query generation
   - Ensure valid output for various inputs

5. **Performance Tests**
   - Benchmark query performance
   - Test with large datasets
   - Verify optimization effectiveness

## Documentation Plan

1. **Developer Documentation**
   - Code documentation (moduledocs, function docs)
   - Implementation details and architecture

2. **User Documentation**
   - Getting started guide
   - Configuration options
   - Common usage patterns
   - Example resources

3. **Tutorials**
