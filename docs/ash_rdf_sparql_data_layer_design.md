# AshRDF SPARQL Data Layer Design Document

## 1. Executive Summary

The AshRDF SPARQL Data Layer extension provides seamless integration between the Ash Framework and SPARQL-enabled RDF stores. This design implements a complete Ash Data Layer that connects to SPARQL endpoints, translates Ash queries into SPARQL, and converts results back to Ash resource instances. By leveraging SPARQL's powerful query capabilities, this data layer enables Ash applications to interact with semantic web data, linked open data repositories, and RDF triplestoresâ€”unlocking the full potential of knowledge graph technologies within the Ash ecosystem.

This document outlines a comprehensive, phased implementation approach that starts with core SPARQL query functionality and gradually builds more advanced features like transactions, changesets, batch operations, and custom optimizations.

## 2. Key Components and Their Interactions

### 2.1 Core Components

#### `AshRdf.DataLayer.Sparql`

- Abstract behavior defining the client interface
- Standardizes connection management and query execution
- Implementations include HTTP and WebSocket clients

#### `AshRdf.Sparql.HttpClient`
- Implementation for standard SPARQL HTTP protocol
- Handles HTTP connections to SPARQL endpoints
- Manages request/response cycles and authentication

#### `AshRdf.Sparql.WebsocketClient`
- Implementation for WebSocket-based SPARQL endpoints
- Handles persistent connections for increased efficiency
- Supports subscription patterns for real-time data

#### `AshRdf.Sparql.ConnectionPool`
- Manages a pool of connections to SPARQL endpoints
- Handles connection lifecycle, timeouts, and retries
- Provides connection checkout/checkin functionality

#### `AshRdf.Sparql.QueryBuilder`
- Translates Ash queries into SPARQL syntax
- Handles filter, sort, pagination, and relationship loading
- Optimizes queries based on resource metadata

#### `AshRdf.Sparql.ResponseParser`
- Parses SPARQL query results (JSON, XML, CSV formats)
- Converts SPARQL results to Ash resource instances
- Handles type conversions and error responses

#### `AshRdf.Dsl.Sections.Sparql`
- Extends the Ash DSL with SPARQL-specific configuration
- Provides options for endpoints, authentication, and query optimization
- Configures resource-to-RDF mappings

### 2.2 Component Interactions

1. **Query Execution Flow**:
   - Ash calls Data Layer with query/action request
   - `AshRdf.DataLayer.Sparql` analyzes the request and passes to `QueryBuilder`
   - `QueryBuilder` constructs a SPARQL query
   - Query is executed via `Client` implementation
   - `ResponseParser` converts results to Ash resources
   - Data Layer returns results to Ash

2. **Resource Configuration Flow**:
   - Resource DSL configuration is processed by `AshRdf.Dsl.Sections.Sparql`
   - Configuration is validated and transformed
   - Resulting configuration is stored in resource metadata
   - Data Layer uses this metadata during query/action execution

3. **Connection Management Flow**:
   - Data Layer requests connection from `ConnectionPool`
   - Pool provides an appropriate client connection
   - Query is executed through the connection
   - Connection is returned to the pool

## 4. Potential Challenges and Mitigation Strategies

### 4.1 Challenges

1. **SPARQL Dialect Differences**:
   - Different triplestores implement slightly different SPARQL dialects
   - Some support extensions or have limitations

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Naive SPARQL queries can be inefficient
   - Relationship loading may require multiple queries

3. **Transaction Support**:
   - SPARQL 1.1 Update introduced transaction support, but implementation varies
   - Achieving Ash's transaction guarantees may be challenging

4. **Type Mapping**:
   - RDF has its own type system that must be mapped to Elixir types
   - Custom datatypes require special handling

5. **Authentication & Security**:
   - SPARQL endpoints use varied authentication mechanisms
   - Sensitive queries must be sanitized to prevent injection

### 4.2 Mitigation Strategies

1. **For Dialect Differences**:
   - Implement adapter pattern for vendor-specific optimizations
   - Create abstraction layer that handles dialect differences
   - Document compatibility matrix for popular triplestores

2. **For Performance**:
   - Implement query optimization techniques (property paths, subqueries)
   - Add configurable batching strategies for relationship loading
   - Support for materialized views or named graphs for frequent queries

3. **For Transactions**:
   - Implement optimistic concurrency control as fallback
   - Support configurable transaction strategies by endpoint capabilities
   - Add retry mechanisms for concurrent modification errors

4. **For Type Mapping**:
   - Create comprehensive type mapper with extensibility points
   - Support custom type handlers in resource configuration
   - Provide defaults that match RDF schema datatypes to Elixir types

5. **For Authentication & Security**:
   - Support multiple authentication mechanisms (Basic, OAuth, API Keys)
   - Implement query parameterization to prevent injection
   - Add connection encryption options

## 5. Testing Approach
